This is version 2013042501 of Regexp::Common510::Number, a module that
provides patterns to recognize specific types of numbers.

It's a pure perl module, and should install anywhere using

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


The module requires Perl 5.10 or later. It will not work on 5.8.x or
before, and there are no plans to backport it.

Development versions can be retrieved from github.
